          Since embarking on this journey to become a Software Developer and
          writing my first program in JavaScript, I have become impassioned with
          coding as a means in solving practical problems. From my days in
          recruitment, Iâ€™ve learned that Software Engineering is a never-ending
          puzzle that has the power to transform and improve the lives of people
          all around the world in all types of capacities.{" "}

          I bring to the table the relentless drive and work ethic of a 4-year
          starting D1 Football Player, the persistence and creativity of an
          engineering recruiter who has made countless full-time placements with
          some of the top companies across the country, and the endless thirst
          for knowledge, that grows with each and every line of code I write.
